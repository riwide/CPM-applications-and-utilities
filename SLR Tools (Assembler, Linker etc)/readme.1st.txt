SLR Tools 

SLR tools is a well-regarded set of tools to assemble and link Z80 code.

The tools are:
Z80ASM, a Z80 assembler
SLR180, a Z180 assembler
SLRNK, a linker which can also work with Microsoft M80 rel files

The above tools are limited in the size that can be handled by the memory (TPA) size.

A flavour of tool is also available, "Plus", originally with "+" after the name, but that is invalid on later DOS/Windows systems so "P" is often used instead.
The "Plus" tools are not limited by the free memory available but use disk space instead.

Each tool has a version-matched configuration program to patch in hard-coded defaults/values for operational parameters. Operational parameters can also be entered at the command line.
